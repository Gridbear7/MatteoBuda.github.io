Python Script: Substance Designer Batch Export Through Python API

(Substance Designer, Automation, Texture Work)



Requirements:

This was originally designed for Substance Designer 2020, I cant speak on later versions as I have not tested but it may work anyways.



Project Desicription:

This script is designed to work in addition to a specifically setup Substance file.
It works by autoamting the process of adjusting a custom attribute and exporting a image file for it. Example: you have a custom attribute linked to say 10 nodes, in order to create a animation sequence on the final output node. Normally you would have to move it x% of your total animation timeline, and export the file manually.
This script will take care of the automatically moving the custom attribute's slider the proper increment amount defined in the code, and exporting the output images to a specified directory, saving a lot of time an headache in this tedious task.
